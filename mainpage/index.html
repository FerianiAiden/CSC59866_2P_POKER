    <h5>Heads-up Position and Dealing </h5>
    <ul>
      <li>The button has the small blind when playing Texas Holdem heads up.</li>
      <li>The person who is the dealer has the button and also posts his/her small blind. This means that the other player (without the button) is the big blind.</li>
      <li>The small blind acts first on the first round of betting before the flop (pre-flop).</li>
      <li>The small blind acts first on the first round of betting before the flop (pre-flop).The dealer (button) deals the small blind the first card, and the second card to the other player (big blind). Deal the 3rd (total) card to the small blind and the last card to the other player. This leaves each player with two hole cards and the first round of pre-flop betting can begin.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Heads-up Pre-flop Betting </h5>
    <ul>
      <li>The small blind can fold, call or raise.</li>
      <li>If the small blind just calls, then the big blind (non-button player) can either check and see the flop, or raise.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h5>All Other Rounds </h5>
    <ul>
      <li>The flop is dealt (3 cards).</li>
      <li>If the small blind just calls, then the big blind (non-button player) can either check and see the flop, or raise.</li>
      <li>The person who was big blind pre-flop is first to act on the flop. (In case you forgot, this is the player who does NOT have the button – the button acts last on all streets except pre-flop.)</li>
      <li>The player who is first to act can bet or check. If that player checks, the button can then bet or check.</li>
      <li>If both players check, then the dealer deals the turn.Repeat the betting sequence for the turn and the river. (the 5th card)</li>
      <li>After all rounds of betting are complete, both players show their hands and the person with the best hand wins!</li>
    </ul>
